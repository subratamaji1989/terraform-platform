# Application Stack Composition

This directory contains the Terraform configuration for the application stack, which orchestrates the deployment of various resources using the defined modules. The application stack is designed to be reusable and configurable through input variables.

## Purpose

The application stack composition serves as the main entry point for deploying the application infrastructure. It integrates multiple modules, such as networking, virtual machines, storage, and load balancers, to create a cohesive environment tailored to application needs.

## Usage

To use this composition, you need to define the necessary input variables in the `variables.tf` file and provide the appropriate values in your YAML configuration files. After configuring the variables, you can run Terraform commands to initialize, plan, and apply the infrastructure.

## Structure

- **main.tf**: Contains the main Terraform configuration that calls the various modules.
- **variables.tf**: Defines the input variables required for the application stack.
- **outputs.tf**: Specifies the outputs from the application stack, allowing other configurations to access important values.

## Example

Refer to the `variables.tf` file for a list of configurable parameters and their descriptions. You can also check the module documentation in the respective directories for more details on how to configure each module.

## Notes

Ensure that all required modules are available and properly configured before deploying the application stack.
